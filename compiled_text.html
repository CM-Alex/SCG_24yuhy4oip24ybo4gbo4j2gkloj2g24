PURPOSE Provide design and planning requirements for new and replacement regulator stations or alteration of existing stations.
1. POLICY AND SCOPE
1.1. Engineered designs are required to assure safe, efficient gas pressure control and adherence to the latest revisions of California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) General Order (GO) 112 and Department of Transportation (DOT) Part 192
2. RESPONSIBILITIES & QUALIFICATIONS
2.1. Measurement Regulation and Control in Gas Engineering is responsible for this Gas Standard as well as technical guidelines and policy regarding the design of regulator stations.
2.2. Distribution Regions and Transmission Districts are responsible for compliance and implementation of this Gas Standard as it pertains to the selection and installation of regulator stations.
3. DEFINITIONS
Not Applicable
4. APPLICATION AND PLANNING
4.1. Regulator stations are installed to supply new loads or to reinforce existing piping systems according to the following:
4.1.1. Engineering Review
The Distribution Regions and Gas Transmission Planning review system computer models and regulator station loads, capacities, pressures and location to determine when new or replacement regulator stations are required as well as provide design parameters to Gas Engineering.
4.1.2. Economic Analysis
Before installing new regulator stations, consider alternatives for meeting the supply needs of the system at an optimum cost (including operation and maintenance).
4.1.3. Design selection
Select the most cost effective standard design, based on design pressure, minimum inlet pressure, maximum outlet pressure, planned future peak hour loads, and total cost of installation and maintenance. If no standard design is available to satisfy all design requirements, request a special design (see section 5 for Standard Design selection and capacity information).

4.2. New Stations
4.2.1. Stations are located, even if additional piping is required, in areas of:
 High ambient noise level to minimize effect of station noise.
 Minimum traffic to provide for ease of access and maintenance.
 Preferred location is the parkway behind the curb line.
 Minimum risk of damage from outside forces.
 Minimum possible interference with pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
 Good drainage to avoid standing water from flooding, irrigation or pavement washing.
 Minimum risk of future franchise activity.
 Above ground, if security and noise level requirements can be satisfied. The security requirements for above ground stations are listed in Table 1.
4.3. High Pressure Distribution and Transmission Taps
4.3.1. See STANDARD 182.0165, Tap Requirements, and Company FORM 883, Application for Tap for tap and record requirements.
4.4. Measurement Requirements
4.4.1. Contact the Design Team of Measurement, Regulation and Control for measurement requirements.
4.5. Filtration
4.5.1. All new or relocated regulator stations require permanent strainer(s) or filter(s) for every regulator run. (See STANDARD 184.0281, Filtration Requirements for Regulator Stations for filtration requirements.)
4.6. Control System
4.6.1. Refer to STANDARD 180.0050, Control Piping for control system construction details.
4.7. Shutoff Valves
4.7.1. Plan shutoff valves upstream and downstream of the regulator station to provide for an emergency shutdown.

4.7.2. Plan valve locations as close to the station as practical but no closer than 25 feet nor further than 500 feet from the station. The measured distance is the straight line distance from the outside vault wall to the upstream end connection of the shutoff valve.
4.7.3. Shutoff valves may be tap valves, if accessible and installed outside the vault with the restrictions noted above.
4.8. Vaults
4.8.1. Vaults must be separated by a minimum distance of 3 feet, or sufficient space to locate the working monitor regulator sensing line connection and provide for future excavation and leak repair on buried piping, whichever is greater.
4.8.2. Refer to STANDARD 180.0100, Prefabricated Vaults - Design and Selection Guide for vault design and selection requirements.
4.8.3. A vault containing gas piping may not be connected by means of a drain connection to any other underground structure.
4.8.4. There must be enough working space so that all of the equipment required in the vault or pit can be properly installed, operated, and maintained.
4.9. Vents
4.9.1. If the internal volume of the vault is greater than 200 cubic feet, install an approved two duct vent system as specified in design drawing number 0329-D.STD (stock code N399782).
4.9.2. If the internal volume of the vault is 200 cubic feet or less, but greater than 75 cubic feet, install an approved vent or seal the vault. A sealed vault is one which eliminates, or minimizes to as practicable a degree as possible, the chances for introducing a source of ignition. A sealed vault is not necessarily air tight and must have a means for testing the internal atmosphere.
4.9.3. If the internal volume of the vault is 75 cubic feet or less, no vent is required.
4.9.4. Refer to STANDARD 180.0100, Prefabricated Vaults - Design and Selection Guide for additional venting information.
4.10. Replacement of Stations
4.10.1. Replace or abandon existing stations when they have become inadequate and alterations are impractical or less economical.
4.11. Alterations in Stations

4.11.1. Alter existing regulator stations, using an Engineering Design, when erosion or foreign material is detected, or when they have become inadequate and it is more economical, including operation and maintenance costs, to alter the station rather than replace it (see STANDARD 184.0281, Filtration Requirements for Regulator Stations for additional filtration requirements and information).
NOTE: The replacement of a single group of items such as regulators or valves with those of the same size, or smaller but of adequate capacity, is considered maintenance rather than an alteration and does not require bringing the whole station up to the current standard or require the use of an Engineering Design.
5. STANDARD DESIGN SELECTION GUIDE AND CAPACITY TABLES
5.1. Select the most cost effective Standard Design that satisfies the design pressure and peak hour capacity requirements at minimum inlet pressure and maximum outlet pressure, using the Decision Tree shown in Figure 1 and Capacity Tables 3-6. Contact the Measurement Regulation and Control (MRC) Design Team for assistance when the required outlet pressure is not included in the capacity tables.
5.2. The Standard Designs listed in Table 2 are available on-line in the Engineering Document Library or MRC website for access and downloading.

PURPOSE Provides guidelines for control piping and regulator settings for new and rebuilt regulator stations, customer MSAs and for regulator station security and identification.
1. MSA AND REGULATOR STATION STANDARD DESIGNS
1.1. For new installations or when re-piping existing regulators, install control systems as specified in regulator station and MSA design procedures. See STANDARD 180.0050, Control Piping.
See Appendix A for listing of regulator function codes and Appendix B, C for function and position numbering examples.
NOTE: Copper tubing or high-pressure hose may be used for temporary testing of regulators, overpressure protection devices, and under pressure protection devices. The copper tubing must be removed before equipment is placed into service.
1.2. During scheduled inspections of existing installations, inspect for and replace all copper tubing, used in any line, which affects operation of regulator, relief valve, or instrument, and all tubing of smaller diameter than specified in STANDARD 180.0050, Control Piping. Select the appropriate design as per Appendix PS.
2. REGULATOR SETTINGS
2.1. Set upstream regulator as monitor:
2.1.1. When paired with an internal sensing service regulator.
2.1.2. When installed as a working monitor. See Appendix D for setting instructions.
2.1.3. When it is a fail-safe closed, overpressure device, at a District Regulator Station.
2.2. Set downstream regulator as monitor:
2.2.1. When both upstream and downstream regulators are Grove expansible element regulators.
2.2.2. When dictated by design drawing.
2.3. In order to arrive at the proper regulator setting, and one that is repeatable during subsequent maintenance, perform the following:

Numbering
SCG: 184.0195

2.3.1. Set regulators and overpressure protection devices against a closed valve by venting the minimum amount of gas to atmosphere that is required to open the regulator main valve. Do not vent gas from the same tap used for pressure gauge.
2.3.2. Compensate for set point shift due to inlet pressure change by adding or subtracting 1.5 psig per 100 psig expected inlet pressure shift. (1.5-psig/100 psig is only a benchmark; experience may dictate a more reliable offset.)
2.3.3. If required in order to maintain authorized delivery pressure, at a customer MSA outlet, make a final service regulator adjustment into system after downstream valve is opened, record the final adjustment pressure against a closed valve as in step 1. Reset monitor as in step 1 to obtain adequate separation in regulator settings.
2.3.4. Regulator lockup pressure must not exceed MAOP limits. At First Stage Regulation (FSR) and Tap Sets, monitor lockup must not exceed 60 psig if there is a standard service regulator downstream. (CFR 192.197)
2.3.5. Leave pressure-adjusting mechanism in a position that requires a tool to change set point. (Tighten lock nuts, etc.)
2.3.6. Isolation/shut off valve for RV or signaling device must be turned off prior to any maintenance work performed on MSA that requires bypassing, to prevent any unexpected pressure at the component. Open valve after work has been completed.
2.4. Mooney Series 20 Pilot Regulator Adjustment
2.4.1. Mooney Series 20 Brass Regulators in these pressure ranges Purple (60- 200 psi), Black (100-280psi), Green (200-450psi) may experience excessive thread wear over time due to maintenance, spring tension, binding, and excessive adjustments. Ejection of adjustment screw is possible if regulator has experienced excessive thread wear.
2.4.2. Units that require multiple adjustments during course of the year, should be inspected for thread wear and replaced, if necessary.
2.4.3. Replace pilot if excessive resistance is experienced while attempting to adjust pilot. (Torque greater than 8 ft. lbs.)
2.4.4. As with all regulators, safe practice is to keep out of line of fire with adjustment screw, when adjusting a pilot regulator.

2.4.5. As a best practice, lubricate adjustment screw with Lubriplate to reduce thread friction.
2.4.6. Do not overtighten locknut after setting adjustment.
3. INSTALLATION APPEARANCE
3.1. Remove debris from installation before leaving.
3.2. Paint piping and metal supports as needed.
4. REGULATOR STATION SECURITY
4.1. Keep fences locked at unattended above-ground metering and regulating stations.
4.2. Arrange for bolting or locking vault covers (as necessary) at regulator stations based on consideration of location, possibility of vandalism and possible consequences of over or under pressuring.
4.3. Secure valves in required position if they can affect controlled pressure and station is not in secured vault or locked fenced enclosure.

APPENDIX D
START UP AND INSPECTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR WORKING MONITOR REGULATORS
Use the Mooney or Fisher sizing program to determine the Working Monitor Pilot setting.
If the sizing programs are not available, use the following equation to calculate Working Monitor Pilot setting:
Normal inlet pressure, less the outlet pressure, multiplied by 0.69 added to the outlet pressure and round to the nearest 10 psig.
Example
Normal inlet pressure = 600 psig – Outlet pressure 200 psig = 400 psig x 0.69 = 276 psig + Outlet pressure 200 psig = 480 psig. (Rounded to the nearest 10 psig)
Identification of Pilot Regulators
 Pilot #1 = 1st Stage Working Monitor Pilot
 Pilot #2 = Monitor Pilot
 Pilot #3 = Service Pilot
START UP
1. Install gauges (inlet, intermediate, between 1st Stage Working Monitor Pilot #1 and Monitor Pilot #2 and outlet).
2. Open short control lines.
3. Set Service Pilot (#3) to a high setting above desired set point (adjustment screw completely buried).
4. Set 1st Stage Working Monitor Pilot (#1) to a high setting above desired set point (adjustment screw completely buried.
5. Set the Monitor Pilot (#2) at a minimum setting (adjustment screw zero setpoint).
6. Set restrictor on 1st Stage Working Monitor Pilot (#1) at an intermediate opening (4).

Note: Minimum bleed is the minimum amount of gas vented to atmosphere required to open regulator mainline valve.
7. Slowly open inlet valve. 1st Stage Working Monitor Pilot (#1) should stay closed as a result of the Monitor Pilot (#2) set at minimum (zero set-point).
8. Create a small downstream bleed.
Note: Short control line for Monitor Pilot (#2) is located between mainline regulators, open a minimum bleed downstream to set regulator.
9. Increase setting of Monitor Pilot (#2) to desired pressure setting. If regulator is unstable, increase restrictor opening until stable.
Note: Intermediate pressure gauge should read full inlet pressure.
10. Close downstream bleed and check for lock up.
11. Create a minimum bleed downstream.
12. Lower set point of Service Pilot (Pilot #3) to desired setting. Tune restrictor, if necessary. 1st Stage Working Monitor Pilot (#1) should open or begin to control intermediate pressure.
Note: Short control line for Monitor Pilot (#2) is located between mainline regulators, open long control line and close short control line. Monitor Pilot (#2) will open, sensing a lower pressure.
13. Adjust set point of 1st Stage Working Monitor Pilot (#1) to achieve desired intermediate pressure. Tune restrictor, if necessary.
14. Close downstream bleed, check lock up on Service Pilot (#3) and 1st Stage Working Monitor Pilot (#1).
Note: Short control line for Monitor Pilot (#2) is located between mainline regulators, proceeds to step 19.
15. Create a minimum downstream bleed.
16. Raise set point of Service Pilot (#3) to verify set point of Monitor Pilot (#2). Adjust if necessary. Check for system stability and adjust the restrictor, if necessary.
17. Return set point of Service Pilot (#3) to maintain desired outlet pressure.
18. Close downstream bleed, check lock up of Service Pilot (#3) and 1st Stage Working Monitor Pilot (#1).

4.6.4. Properly installed and protected from dirt, liquids, or other conditions that might prevent proper operation.
4.6.5. For steel pipelines whose MAOP is determined under §192.619(c), if the MAOP is 60 psi (414 kPa) gage or more, the control or relief pressure limit is as follows:
If the MAOP produces a hoop stress that is:
Then the pressure limit is:
Greater than 72 percent of SMYS
MAOP plus 4 percent.
Unknown as a percentage of SMYS
A pressure that will prevent unsafe operation of the pipeline considering its operating and maintenance history and MAOP.
4.7. Pressure relief devices at pressure limiting stations and pressure regulating stations must have sufficient capacity to protect the facilities to which they are connected. Except as provided in §192.739(b), the capacity must be consistent with the pressure limits of §192.201(a). This capacity must be determined at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar year, by testing the devices in place or by review and calculations.
4.8. If review and calculations are used to determine if a device has sufficient capacity, the calculated capacity must be compared with the rated or experimentally determined relieving capacity of the device for the conditions under which it operates. After the initial calculations, subsequent calculations need not be made if the annual review documents that parameters have not changed to cause the rated or experimentally determined relieving capacity to be insufficient.
4.9. If a relief device is of insufficient capacity, a new or additional device must be installed to provide the capacity required by paragraph (4.7) of this section.

stations and power plants. The supervisor of region measurement functions is responsible for assuring all equipment is accounted for and inspected on time.
5.2. Regulator stations and power generating plants must be inspected at least once each calendar year. Inspections, including remedial work, are completed during the base inspection (anniversary) month, or within the “grace” period (defined as one month following the base inspection month for customers and 3 months following the base inspection month for District Regulator Stations. Exceptions are:
5.2.1. Customer inspections with a base month for January must be completed in January or February.
5.2.2. District Regulator Station inspections with a base month for January must be completed in January, February, March or April.
5.2.3. December base month inspections must be completed in December.
5.2.4. Bi-annual inspections must be completed within their base month, and again during their 6-month anniversary (no “grace period”).
5.2.5. Quarterly inspections must be completed within their base month, and again during each 3-month anniversary (no “grace period”).
Note: Supervisor approval required if a Base Month is to be changed from original. Contact MRC staff for assistance.
6. INSPECTING A REGULATOR STATION THAT IS SHUT-IN, DE-ENERGIZED, LOCK-OUT TAG OUT DUE TO PROJECT WORK OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES.
6.1. Use natural gas bottle(s) also known as Meter Change Device (MCD) to temporarily supply inlet pressure to stations when it’s reasonable and safe to do so.
6.2. Meter Change Device (MCD) is used when the required inlet pressure to regulator station isn’t available. A typical CNG cylinder holds approximately 348 cubic feet of gas.
6.3. Consult with local supervision prior to using alternate source of supply pressures and/or when shut in station is unable to be inspected.
6.4. See section 7 of this gas standard for additional instructions.

7. COMPANY ASSETS THAT ARE UNABLE TO BE INSPECTED WITHIN COMPLIANCE WINDOW.
If upon arrival the asset is unable to be inspected due to; project work, de-energized, lock-out tag out, and or shut-in due to abnormal operating conditions or compromised piping or equipment, responsible personnel will take the following steps:
7.1. Place Work Order in ‘Action Required’ (Distribution) or “follow up” work order (Transmission) and notify supervisor immediately.
7.2. Supervisor will monitor the work order compliance dates and asset status. If assessment determines that asset inspection cannot be completed by the scheduled base month inspection date plus 3 month grace period, supervisor will notify the Region Asset Maintenance and Inspection Manager.
7.3. Region supervisor is responsible for notifying the Maximo Support Team and M&R Process and Compliance Support when base month change is required.
7.4. When the base month inspection plus 3 month grace period cannot be met, the regulator station base inspection month will be modified in SAP and Maximo to the month when the regulator station is placed back in service. A documented inspection is required prior to placing the station back in service.
7.5. If a regulator station remains shut-in and uninspected for over 1 year, an internal inspection is required before placing the station back in service.
7.6. Once station has been reinstated after 1 year or more “out of service” condition, perform follow up external inspection within two weeks of reactivation.
7.7. A temporary ID drawing is issued for unattended shut-in stations due to ; project work, de-energized and lock-out tag out.
7.8. Temporary drawings can be hand drawn and must show current inlet and outlet valve positions (Open or Closed).
7.9. Temporary “Do Not Operate” tags are placed on valves that are not in their normal operating position.
7.10. Temporary drawings/signage is removed once station is returned to normal operating status and standard drawings are reinstated. 7.11. Electronic pressure monitors (EPM) at stations that have been shut-in will be temporarily deactivate when the normal inlet pressure supply to EPM is no longer available. Notify region engineering when deactivating EPM. Region engineering

must find alternate location for EPM or evaluate if pressure district can operate without the EPM.
8. SAP-PM Self-Audit
8.1. Supervisors and Leads will be able to verify all outstanding and completed orders through SAP-PM. SAP-PM will create and Click Schedule will issue work orders.
8.1.1. NOTE: With the roll out of OpEx, clerks, leads and supervisors will run daily reports against open notifications and orders in SAP for suspect non-compliance work. These reports are available via standard SAP or through SAP-BW. When Click Release 8 is rolled out, an exception report for preventive orders due and any orders near due date that will go into “Jeopardy” will be developed to allow the appropriate Supervisor to take immediate action. Reports should be run daily to ensure strict adherence to inspection intervals for compliance to CPUC and DOT rules and regulations.
9. Expansible Element and Diaphragm
9.1. SAP-PM determines the interval, creates the preventive work order and Click Schedule issues the order to perform internal-parts-replacement (IPR) inspections for diaphragm or expansible elements at varying internals (depending on type and manufacturer) not to exceed fifteen (15) years.
9.2. Replace pilot diaphragms and valve seats etc., with associated mainline regulator IPR inspections.
NOTE: District Regulator Stations - Internally inspect expansible element regulators every 2 years if used as a monitor with pilot that bleeds either to atmosphere or into another system. The SAP-PM maintenance plan must be updated manually for each regulator meeting the above criteria.
Customer MSA’s - Externally inspect expansible element regulators every 12 months if used as a monitor with pilot that bleeds either to atmosphere or into another system. The SAP-PM maintenance plan must be updated manually for each regulator meeting the above criteria.
Contact MRC – Measurement Technologies to request updates to each regulator maintenance plan meeting above criteria.

APPENDIX B
PISTON-OPERATED VALVE REGULATOR INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS
Provide guidelines while performing the following requirements for periodic inspections at district regulator stations and customer large meter sets.
9. External Inspection
9.1. Put installation on bypass if necessary. Stand clear of actuator movement at all times.
9.2. Shut off supply through piston-operated valve by closing its upstream or downstream mainline valve.
9.3. Check operation of controllers, air control or relay valves, positioners, other instruments and valve actuators. If controller has reset action, check to see that it is working properly.
9.4. Check and verify settings, and check and record lock-up differences of all control line devices (as applicable) and regulators associated with the piston-operated valve regulator. Verify equipment is tagged correctly.
NOTE: Lock-up difference for the piston-operated valve regulator is recorded as difference between controller (pilot) setting, and minimum induced closing pressure, required to fully close the main valve.
9.5. Three-Point Check on BPE regulators, perform the following:
9.5.1. Ball Valve Check
 Check mainline regulator for lock-up. In addition, check ball valve condition by blowing down body cavity while in the closed position. This check determines condition of both inner and outer seat rings.
 If valve fails to shut down completely, lubricate valve per GS 184.16, Valve Inspection and Maintenance — Distribution.
NOTE: All Grove ball valves are designed not to require sealant. However, our Company's experience has identified the need to lubricate these valves under certain conditions. When lubrication is necessary use #47 Mobil lubricant.

 If complete blow-down is not achieved by lubrication, determine which seat ring is bad by distinguishing whether the blow-by is created from the inlet or outlet pressure. Leakage due to erosion is a greater possibility when regulator is under throttling conditions rather than when as an on-off device.
NOTE: Notify Technical Services to develop a plan for valve repairs.
9.5.2. Pneumatic Cylinder Leak Test
Operate valve actuator several times to flex the piston seals. Check for piston seal blow-by. This is done by venting piston side without the pressure and placing a soap bubble on vented fitting. Check both sides of piston using this method. If the leak test indicates evidence of leakage, complete inspection and notify your Measurement Supervisor.
9.5.3. Cylinder Rod Linkage Check ("Lost Motion")
Operate valve actuator to inspect regulator for lost motion. When this is done measure the travel indicator motion between cylinder movement and the start of ball valve rotation. This travel should be approximately 1/8-inch. Travel exceeding 1/4-inch is excessive and could affect control accuracy. Contact your Measurement Supervisor when this condition is discovered.
NOTE: A 10-to-20-psig signal should be used to operate actuator without moving ball when checking for lost motion
9.6. Operate all other valve actuators several times to flex the piston seals. It is the number of reversals of travel that is important.
9.7. Lubricate valve. If Grove ball valve, refer to item I.5.1 (a) Ball Valve Check.
9.8. Lubricate Ledeen valve actuators with automotive chassis grease.
9.9. Lubricate positioner linkage on valve regulators. Include pulleys on Foxboro’s and ball joints on Baileys. Use Lubriplate, M&S Code N453055.
9.10. Lubricate Ledeen Spanseal positioner by turning lubrication fitting one full turn. Use Dow Corning #4 compound - special purchase item from Ledeen.
9.11. Check and report all other associated regulators and pneumatic equipment for lock-up and correct operation, i.e., positioners, controllers, no bleed pilots and pneumatic control valves.

9.12. Return equipment to normal operation. Verify that all valves, regulators, controllers set points, reset knobs, etc. are in correct position.
10. INTERNAL (VISUAL) INSPECTIONS
Internal inspections include all external inspection requirements plus the following:
10.1. Check oil level in body and oil dampening loop where applicable on plug and ball valve actuators. Oil level in body should be down a little and dampening loop should be full. Use SAE 50 or non-detergent motor oil 40 in body and rotary meter oil (Code 45-7800) in dampening loop.
10.2. Clean and lubricate the piston rod and rollers on operators that do not have an oil bath. Use Lubriplate, M&S Code N453055.
10.3. Check valves in controllers, positioners and other pneumatic control valves. Do not lubricate.
10.4. Check that valve positioner intake and exhaust screens are not plugged with foreign material.
10.5. Inspect all filters including built-in filters in Fisher 67F pilots and Bailey or Foxboro positioners. Clean or replace as necessary.
10.6. Blow all control and instrument supply lines.
10.7. Operate all valves equipped with valve actuators and record or verify the operating pressure. Reduce supply pressure to 24 psi and increase in 5-psi increments until valve operates. Compare with previous readings. If significant increase has occurred, lubricate or take other corrective action.
10.8. BPE regulators do not require an internal inspection if the three-point checks are performed on schedule. See Section 1.5 of Appendix B.
10.9. Fisher HiBall and V-Ball regulators do not require an internal inspection of the ball valve, except as indicated by operation tests.

AMERICAN SCHOOL OF GAS MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY
INTRODUCTION
A gas pressure regulator is an automatic device which
controls the media flow and maintains a desired media
pressure while reducing the media supply pressure.
The basic regulator could be an operator at a control
valve watching a pressure gauge. The valve is manually
opened to allow the line pressure to achieve the desired
gauge setting. The operator then visually monitors the
gauge and either opens the valve or closes it to maintain
the desired pressure. The problem with this system is it
would require full time operators for daily operation and
continuous monitoring of the gauge. The regulator
products on the market do not monitor the gauge.
However, via monitoring the outlet pressure, they do
automatically open and/or close the valve to control the
outlet pressure at an established value.
The manually operated regulator is still employed by gas
companies to provide uninterrupted service during
repairs or replacement of a regulator on a single feed
system.
SPRING REGULATOR
The spring type regulator is by far the most widely used
regulator. The design is simple, but effective. The spring
style regulator employs a restrictive element, a
responsive element, and a standard. The restrictive
element can be a single valve, double valve, sleeve
multivane, or a balanced valve design. The responsive
element can be a diaphragm or piston. The standard
can be a spring, weight, or pressure. We shall discuss
the spring style self-operated regulators.
The service style regulators employ a lever ratio to control
an unbalanced single valve. The lever is operated by a
diaphragm, and the standard is a spring. The spring load
is adjustable and can be increased or decreased to satisfy
the load requirements. Once the pressure requirements
have been established, the service regulator will
automatically respond to load changes and control the
pressure. If the load increases, the outlet pressure will begin
to drop which reduces the pressure under the diaphragm.
The loss of pressure allows the spring to move the
diaphragm and in turn, through the lever ratio, moves the
restrictive element to a greater opening. The opening of
the orifice then feeds more media flow into the downstream.
The regulator will automatically effect a balance position
and satisfy the gas requirement. Should the demand
decrease, the opposite effect occurs and the regulator will
again automatically adjust the valve position until the new
load requirement is satisfied. If the demand reduces to
zero, the outlet pressure will increase until the valve seals
off the orifice opening.
INLET EFFECT
A change in inlet pressure will reposition the valve. If the
inlet begins to drop, the flow begins to decrease, pressure
under the diaphragm begins to decrease, and the valve
begins to open. Keep in mind that the demand is not
changing. Only the inlet pressure is changing and it is
dropping. A drop in inlet means a decrease in flow, and
the valve action works to maintain the constant flow.
Thus, when the inlet pressure settles out at a lower value,
equilibrium is restored at a new valve position. The
opposite occurs for an increased inlet pressure, therefore,
the loss of inlet pressure will decrease the outlet pressure
and a gain will increase the outlet pressure. This is a
phenomena commonly referred to as inlet effect.
DROOP
Spring regulators have a characteristic called “DROOP,”
“DEVIATION,” or “OFFSET.” It is a change that occurs in
outlet pressure as flow increases. At minimum flow, outlet
pressure is at a maximum. At maximum flow, outlet
pressure is at a minimum. The pressure change difference
between the two is the droop value. Droop will vary
dependent upon the spring, regulator, and product
design. Droop results from the spring expanding as it
increases in length during the valve opening process.
As the spring expands, its compression decreases. For
equilibrium between opening and closing forces, the
closing force from the diaphragm must decrease at the
same rate. This decrease is produced by a drop in the
outlet pressure. The reverse occurs as the valve closes,
and thus pressure varies between low and high limits as
the regulator strokes between fully open and closed.
The characteristic of the spring is called “SPRING
EFFECT” and the resulting droop is compounded by
what is called the “DIAPHRAGM EFFECT.” It is a
characteristic that causes the diaphragm’s effective area
to increase while the spring compression is decreasing,
and vice versa. This creates more droop . . . a further
change in outlet pressure.
“ROLL-OUT” DIAPHRAGM
The “ROLL-OUT” diaphragm was developed to eliminate
the diaphragm effect by forcing the diaphragm area to

decrease as the regulator valves were opening. By
causing the diaphragm area to decrease instead of
increase, the diaphragm effect was not only eliminated,
but some of the spring effect was also eliminated. While
perfect coordination between the two effects is
impractical, it is sufficiently close so that the excess
droop is eliminated. This change allowed usage of the
diaphragm operated regulators to higher outlet pressures
were heretofore excessive levels of the droop usually
made performance unacceptable.
BOOST
Boost is another method of counteracting droop. Some
products are designed with respect to flow pattern and
outlet pressure sensing that causes the outlet pressure
to elevate above its actual setting by creating a false
pressure under the diaphragm. The service regulator
employs valve design, boost tubes, body rings, venturi
tubes, etc. to create the boosting characteristic. The
design must prevent excessive boosting which could
result in loss of regulator control.
TEMPERATURE
Pressure differential results in a refrigeration effect of
approximately 7 degrees Fahrenheit temperature loss per
100 psig pressure differential. Therefore, at elevated
pressure differential media conditioning or injection of
an anti-freezing agent may be required to prevent
problems.
SELF-OPERATED REGULATORS
The basic regulator for pressure control is a self-operated
regulator. Self-operated regulators are the simplest units.
The typical regulator consists of valves attached to a
diaphragm which is spring loaded. The outlet pressure
acts on the diaphragm opposite the spring. The
diaphragm must withstand the full outlet pressure as one
side is exposed to the atmosphere. The diaphragm size
is varied to provide a range of desired delivery pressures.
The smaller the diaphragm, the higher the outlet pressure
range given the same weight or spring force. The selfoperated
regulator is commonly referred to as fail open.
This is true if the diaphragm should fail. However, no
regulator can be classified as fail open or closed. If the
right conditions exist, a regulator can fail in any mode.
The spring loaded regulator has actually emerged as the
acceptable self-operated unit. Spring loaded regulators
are similar to the older weight loaded in ease of
adjustment and simplicity. The big advantage is that the
spring loaded unit can be easily sealed against
tampering. In addition, when properly vented, the spring
loaded unit can be used where flooding conditions may
occur.
The “roll-out” diaphragm greatly improved the
performance of the spring operated regulator. The unit
displays very little outlet pressure loss throughout its
capacity range, and closely approaches the performance
displayed by pressure loaded units. The drawback to
the diaphragm type self-operated regulator is the
pressure limitations due to diaphragm strengths and the
spring size required for high outlet pressures. Various
valve sizes can be employed in a spring operated unit;
however, the small diaphragms for high pressure cannot
generate sufficient power to control very large valves.
PROTECTION
Protection is a subject that has not been given sufficient
concern in past years by the gas industry or the
manufacturers. However, there is a growing awareness
across the country for the need for overpressure
protection.
The problems faced by the gas industry is “how safe is
safe enough.” And the answer is an unknown factor. The
problem then faced by the manufacturer is supplying
the needs of the gas industry which is dealing in a
confusing array of solutions to overpressure protection.
We will attempt to note some of the various methods of
overpressure protection including internal relief valves,
back pressure regulators, monitoring, and relief valves.
INTERNAL RELIEF VALVES
The Internal Relief Valve (IRV) is a relief valve designed
into a regulator product. It does not operate until the
outlet pressure exceeds the delivery pressure by a certain
amount. The buildup in outlet pressure is dependent
upon a number of factors including inlet pressure, type
of blockage or leakage, IRV spring and normally the rate
of the main spring. There have been other designs in the
past. However, the basic design employed on service
style regulators is the IRV which must overcome the main
spring’s force to open. The outlet pressure spring effects
relief buildup, and therefore the actual relief buildup curve
is dependent upon the outlet pressure spring and failure
simulated. The higher outlet pressures require larger
spring forces and higher spring rates and results in a
greater outlet pressure buildup.
The IRV, when opened, will discharge gas to atmosphere
through the vent and/or vent line. We do not recommend
combining regulator vent lines into a common discharge
header. Those regulators not relieving will become
pressure loaded units when common vent lines are
employed.
BACK PRESSURE REGULATORS
The regulator products provide a method of controlling
flow rate and pressure reduction. However, a number of
regulator products can be assembled and employed as
a back pressure regulator or relief valve. The back
pressure regulator is designed with the main valves in a
normally closed position and the low pressure chamber
is piped to the inlet side of the regulator. On remote

control regulators and on internal control regulators, the
normal outlet chamber is piped to receive the inlet
pressure. The manufacturer may remove the normal flow
arrow from the body and add a new flow arrow in the
opposite direction, unless the body has bi-directional
capability.
MONITORING
The practice of monitoring has been employed for quite
some time. A monitoring system has two regulators. One
regulator is the operator or the unit that is controlling the
media flow into the downstream system. The second
regulator is the monitor or standby regulator which will
not come into operation until an overpressure condition
is experienced. The monitor regulator is set at a slightly
higher pressure than the operator so that it is wide open.
Some utilities prefer to employ a working monitor which
means that the two regulators are set closer together to
ensure movement of the standby regulator so that it will
function when called upon. The monitor regulator can
be either upstream or downstream of the operator.
There are advantages and disadvantages to both
configurations, so it is company preference and
experience which governs the location. Monitoring, when
employed using pilot operated regulators, normally
requires load limiting regulators between the inlet
pressure and the pilot inlet to minimize the inlet pressure
to the pilot when it is trying to operate in a wide open
condition. When sizing monitor systems, the capacity of
the system will be equal to the capacity of the smaller
regulator in the system times 70%. The reduction of 30%
is due to the pressure conditions created at higher flow
rates and the intermediate pressure between the two
regulators.
The monitor or standby regulator will prevent overpressurization
of the downstream piping system by
automatically coming into service and controlling the
media flow into the downstream at a slightly higher
pressure, and, if the cause of the overpressure corrects
itself, the system will return to normal operation
automatically.
RELIEF VALVES
One of the oldest forms of protection is by using relief
valves. There have been many styles of relief valves over
the years. However, they all open at a preset relief point
and discharge the media to atmosphere. The relief valve
will only open far enough to balance off the excess flow
into the downstream system. If the overpressure cause
is corrected or self-corrects, the relief valve will blow
down and reseal. The relief valve can be a pop type relief
valve typical of a cork in a bottle, a pop type with an
assisting diaphragm typical of the Rockwell 250 Style
Relief Valve, a diaphragm activated typical of the 257S
Relief Valve, and/or Pilot operated units.
SAFETY
The discharge of natural gas to atmosphere can cause a
safety problem. Therefore, care should be exercised in
placing the Relief Valve discharge in a safe location. The
discharge should be in a remote area away from
buildings, people, and open flames.
The safety of the products in the piping system dictates
the need for safety devices to prevent overpressurization.
Preventing overpressurization of the pressure system can
be accomplished by many means as noted above and/
or a combination of the noted practices.
There is not a recommended procedure or standard
practice for prevention of outlet pressure buildup.
However, the allowable overpressure on our regulator
products was defined and the values generated in the
mid 1970’s as noted and documented by Bulletin RDS-
1498.
The standard practice is to design products to withstand
a pressure of 5 to 6.67 times the product’s maximum
working pressure prior to bursting. The pressure
containing components, prior to shipment to a customer,
are tested to a pressure of 1.5 or 2 times the component’s
maximum working pressure. The variation is based on
material and/or processes employed to obtain parts.
Care should be exercised in the determination of
maximum working pressures on the product. In addition,
prior to installation of a product, the manufacturer’s
bulletin should be carefully reviewed to determine the
maximum applicable pressure. Maximum pressures can
be inlet loading, outlet relief, etc. and they can vary with
body material orifice size, case size, case material, etc.
The protection of the public is very important and every
effort should be made to properly install the product to
prevent a hazard due to improper installation, application,
and usage. The discharge of natural gas to atmosphere
can create a potential hazard if not properly discharged
into a safe area to prevent ignition.
Regulator products are mechanical devices which can
fail. Therefore, every effort should be made to ensure
that the product is working properly through a
preventative maintenance, testing and inspection
program. The functionality of overpressure protection
equipment should be tested on a periodic basis to ensure
that the product functions properly or will function when
necessary. The frequency of testing and inspection would
depend upon a number of factors including federal
codes, state codes, company standards, etc. However,
if no codes or standards presently exist, Equimeter feels
one should be established by the gas company.
SIZING AND SELECTION
The sizing and selection of regulators can be
accomplished by various methods. However, the factors
involved are the same regardless of the methods used.
PAGE 30 2001 PROCEEDINGS
AMERICAN SCHOOL OF GAS MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY
The rules for regulator sizing apply equally whether large
capacity or small capacity.
The only difference is in the fact that the large capacity
regulator is sized for a specific installation whereas the
small regulator is sized covering a group or category of
similar installations. The gas pressure regulators are
extremely versatile and often handle conditions far
beyond the normal sized for so that mistakes rarely show.
Sizing is not an art. However, obtaining and determining
the required capacity and conditions can be considered
an art. Sizing is the determination of the proper valve
size to obtain the desired capacity at the inlet and outlet
pressures of the installation. To determine the proper
valve size, it is necessary that the maximum required
flow be known, the inlet pressure range be established,
and the required delivery pressure is known. Getting this
information is far harder than using it to size the regulator.
Each manufacturer provides “valve coefficients” or
capacity tables so that by proper use of these tables
and coefficients, the flow for a given valve size can be
determined. The required maximum capacity of any given
regulator must be used with the minimum inlet pressure
conditions to properly size the port openings.
If the conditions at the installation are known, the
foregoing is normally very easy. The capacity required
at an installation will usually cause problems due to the
way it is determined, unless it is an existing location and
all conditions are known from past operating records.
New station requirements are based on a load survey of
the service area or the estimated requirements of the
equipment installed in a large industrial plant. At this
point, we are faced with estimating present load
requirements and also estimating future load
requirements for the plant or area. The normal reflex is
to add excess capacity to be sure the installation will
have sufficient capacity. The results are normally a
regulator sized far too big and one that will cause trouble
in maintaining control. Fortunately, there are ways of
handling the uncertainty of future demands. The best
method is a parallel run where one unit is installed with
reduced valves. Sizing a regulator with reduced valves
should be considered a two-step effort. The first step
would be to consider the future and install sufficient body
size of these requirements. The second step is to
consider the immediate demands and install the valve
size accordingly.
The second problem in sizing, after determination of the
installation capacity, is determining the inlet pressure
range. The gas industry faces the problem of having
greatest flow when the least pressure is available. The
minimum inlet pressure can be determined by line loss
calculations and the conditions at the source. It is
possible to arrive at a very accurate estimate of the inlet
pressure conditions. The maximum inlet pressure must
be known to properly determine the required body
strength and the amount of turndown that will be
handled. The maximum capacity coupled with the
maximum inlet pressure can indicate the possibility of
stability problems. Normally a regulator will handle
turndown ratios of 10:1 without problems and 20:1 are
common; however, very high ratios will indicate potential
stability problems and should be avoided by parallel runs
or installation of “V” port wings if available to improve
turndown ratio of approximately 40:1.
The type of control must be considered for the accuracy
and stability. The control must be capable of providing the
outlet pressure required. The type and condition of the gas
must be considered to properly select valve materials and
if necessary, provide auxiliary equipment to protect against
hydrates. Noise pollution is becoming more and more
important and must be given consideration. Flooding,
corrosive gases, and various codes must also be
considered as they apply to a given installation.</pre>
